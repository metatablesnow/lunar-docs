Before we start, it's recommended you are already proficient in Luau.

A command can either be local and remote, or just local:

import { User } from 'lucide-react';
import { HardDrive } from 'lucide-react';
 
<Cards>
  <Card icon={<User color="#4A90E2"/>} href="/" title="Local Commands">
    Local commands are good for commands which won't affect other players, take `ping` (or basically any movement command) for example, it simply displays the client their current ping in milliseconds. 
  </Card>
    <Card icon={<HardDrive color="#F5A623"/>} href="/" title="Local and Remote Commands">
    Local and Remote commands are good for commands which will affect other players, take `announce` for example, a player tells the server what they want to announce, and the server tells every client to display that message.
  </Card>

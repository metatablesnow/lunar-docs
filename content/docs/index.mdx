## Installing Lunar

### Installing via Roblox

If you are creating an experience within Roblox Studio, you can import the `.rbxm` file directly:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Visit [Lunar's Release Page](https://github.com/metatablesnow/Lunar/releases)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the **Assets** dropdown to view the downloadable files.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the `Lunar.rbxm` file to download it.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In Roblox Studio, right-click on `ServerStorage`, and select **Insert from File**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the `Lunar.rbxm` file you just downloaded.
    <Callout>
      You can place `LunarServer` wherever you'd like, though we recommend keeping it directly in `ServerStorage` or inside a folder within it.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Drag the `LunarClient` module from inside `LunarServer` to `ReplicatedStorage`. This can also be placed elsewhere, but `ReplicatedStorage` is recommended.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Now we need a couple scripts to initialize Lunar:

    **1. Server Script**  
    Create a `Script` inside of `ServerScriptService`. Remove the default code and paste in the following:

    ```lua
    local LunarServer = require(path.to.Lunar)

    LunarServer.Init(path.to.LunarClient)
    ```

    **2. Local Script**  
    Create a `LocalScript` inside of `StarterPlayerScripts`. Remove the default code and paste in the following:

    ```lua
    local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
    local LunarClient = require(path.to.LunarClient)

    LunarClient.Init({
      defaultPanelToggleKeycode = Enum.KeyCode.M
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### ðŸŽ‰ Lunar is now ready to use!

You can now press <kbd>M</kbd> (or whichever key you set for `defaultPanelToggleKeycode`) to open Lunar.

**You might notice some things are missing** â€” the commands!  
To register the default commands, add this line of code to your server script *before* initializing Lunar:

```lua
LunarServer:RegisterDefaultCommands()
```

## FAQ & Important Tips

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="If you are already using Fusion">
    It's recommended to replace the Fusion that Lunar ships with, with the one you're already using, to reduce redundancy and keep things clean.

    The bundled Fusion module can be found here:

    <Files>
      <Folder name="LunarClient" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="Modules" defaultOpen>
          <File name="Fusion.luau" icon={<FileBox />} />
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Files>

    To replace it, delete the old Fusion `ModuleScript`, make a new `ModuleScript`, name it 'Fusion', and replace the default code with:
    ```lua
    return require(path.to.Fusion)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
